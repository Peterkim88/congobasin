INTRODUCTION
Please enjoy the adventures you will have in the Basin through this fullstack project which is an attempt to clone the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> website. This project was chosen due to my background with working for wholesale companies and mainly wanted to work on the vendor side of the app. However, this website will show the buyer end that is more familiar with the majority of the world. You will be able to sign up and login, add items to the cart with products you would like to purchase, leave reviews of the items that have been purchased, and sign up as a vendor to add products to the Congo Basin product listings.
